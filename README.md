## BotStackjs

## Why?
We believe the beginning of a successful bot has little to do with engineering and everything to do with the skill of the product owner in acquiring users and keeping them faster than their competition.

That's why we've open sourced our Facebook Messenger node.js code base so you can get all the latest features from API.AI, Facebook Messenger and Analytics like Dashbot and BotMetrics. While setting yourself up for success with a robust and extensible code base when you've tested your assumptions and are ready for an engineer to build domain specific features.
